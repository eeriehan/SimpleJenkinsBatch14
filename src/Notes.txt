CI/CD:
    continues integration and continues development.
    All the software that we use weather it's a website or app or any operating system.
    They are in a continued state of change. we need to continuously develop and update
    these software so that the customer can use the latest features. Jenkins is one such
    software that will help us automate this process.

1)  Once the software is ready and looks good on the developers machine. Developer pushes
    that code to the development server. Dev verifies the changes and runs a few test
    cases to make sure all works fine.
2)  Once all looks good, QA will request to deploy the changes on QA server. We also need
    to take approvals from team leads or managers.
3)  Once all looks good on QA, take approval from head of team write an email again to
    deploy all the changes to staging server.
4)  once all look good on staging do the same for the production.
